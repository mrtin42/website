# i am so sad

i have to go back to school next week and that is utterly diabolical. stupid school. i hate it. i hate it so much. i hate it so much i am going to write a blog post about it. i hate it so much i am going to write a blog post about it and then i am going to post it on my website. 

LOL just kidding school isn't so bad. but enough about the sad end to the festive season, lets talk ABOUT the festive season. i got a lot of cool stuff for christmas, including but not limited to:

- money
- a doctor who novel (and i bought another one with the money kekw)
- a deplorable amount of chocolate which i managed to eat in the space of about 3 days
- some transport for london merchandise (i am a nerd)

birthday is coming up soon too, i am going to get a raspberry pi 5!! i am so excited. i am going to self host my minecraft server on it (or try at least). i also might try and host some proxy SMTP/IMAP servers on it too, so i can circumvent protonmails local bridge when using SMTP. if that works i'll be so happy u have no idea how hard i've been trying to do all this with my pitiful raspberry pi 3. ONE SOLE GIGABYTE OF RAM. i am so excited for the pi 5. i am going to get the 8gb model. maybe, though, so i won't get my hopes up too much. but 4gb is still a lot better than 1gb LMFAO.

in other news i bought a fresh new domain to add to my ever-growing collection (this is an impulsive buying addiction and i need to see a psychiatrist). and its a REGISTRY PREMIUM. martin.blue is amazing i am so happy its literally the best domain ever. my name and my favourite colour: what more could i ask for? i am so happy. i am going to use it for my email address (actually i'll leave that down to mbfrias.co.uk because i'll need to change my email address on so many accounts and i can't be bothered to do that right now) and as you can probably tell i've already set it up for my website.

it also saves me the hassle of using mbfrias.com for subdomains because it doesn't look so ugly like marrtin.com did.

BLIMEY thats alot of paragraphs. i think i'll stop here. this is the most effort i've ever put into a piece of literature ever wth????? anyways, have a great weekend. 

edit 1: LOL WTH I PUT THE WRONG YEAR??? ITS 2024 NOT 2021 LMFAO happy new year btw
