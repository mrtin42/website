# feburary

today is the 4th of feburary. i've just woken up and guess what? it's my dad's birthday. i'd make a joke about how old he is but i don't want to get disowned LOL!

so recently i've had an epiphany where I AM BLOODY OBSESSED WITH ANGEL DUST FROM HAZBIN HOTEL. i've been watching the show recently and for some reason that guy is just brilliant everything about him (okay for obvious reasons not **everything** about him but you get the point). i can't stop listening to poison from the OST like seriously look at my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/t_ube) i've been listening to it non-stop.

i've also been watching a lot of doctor who recently. but this isn't news: i confessed my love for the toymaker in my [second test blog post](/blog/again). so lets talk about something else. something REALLY cool.

okay here's the REALLY cool thing i mentioned about 9 words ago: i started a new project!! it's called [??RE??D???ACT???E?D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and it's a ??RE??D???ACT???E?D. i'm adding a lot of features to it such as ??RE??D???ACT???E?D, ??RE??D???ACT???E?D and ??RE??D???ACT???E?D!! i'm so excited to have gotten to share this with you all. i guess i am overhyping this up like some apple product launch when in reality it's just a ??RE??D???ACT???E?D. but i'm still excited.

also planning on touching up my website a bit. i'm keeping this kickass design but i'm going to standardise fonts and colours and stuff, because pages like the [projects](/projects) page and the [domains](/domains) page look a bit... messy??? so that's going to happen. expect to see that before ??RE??D???ACT???E?D is released.

i think that's all for now. i'm going to go get breakfast and then start celebrating my dad's birthday. i hope you all have a great day too.

edit 1: got the url slug and post title wrong smh i need to pattern up fr
