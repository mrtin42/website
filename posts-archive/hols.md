# i lied

i'm not going to be productive this easter holiday. i'm going to be doing the same thing i do every holiday: absolutely nothing. i'm going to be watching avatar: the last airbender, south park, doctor who, some hazbin hotel, and maybe some other stuff. i'm going to be listening to the same music i always listen to because its great music.

i recently had the most infuriating moment of realisation. recently my contributions sheet on github has been looking a bit empty. i've been working on a lot of stuff but it still seemed s empty and boring as if i had done nothing. it was so odd commits were being pushed like normal and then it struck me - visual studio code was using incorrect commit author details. i recently changed my github username and email and i forgot to update the settings in visual studio code. so now i have a bunch of commits that are attributed to a non-existent user. i'm going to have to go through and fix that. i'm not looking forward to it. for goodness sake, me!

speaking of infuriating things and people, IM SICK OF PLANETSCALE. in what world is it normal to hey "what is up free users! lol sorry but no more free tier for you! sux 2 b u xd!!!! pay up or get out!" like seriously. i'm not going to be using planetscale anymore. whats worse is that their cheapest tier to keep the exact same configuration i had before is $46 a month. FORTY SIX DOLLARS A MONTH. i'm not paying that. i'm going to have to find a new database provider. i'm not happy about this. this meant i had to suspend MLINX.co because now it doesn't work. absolutely ridiculous. get a grip, sam lambert.

i am still head over heels for angel dust. felt like you needed reminding cos hes so hot like DAMN!!!

on the subject of things that are really hot, heres something thats not hot and actually seriously ugly to me. the contract between non-scrolling pages on my site like the [root page](/) and the [contact](/contact) page and the scrolling pages like the [blog](/blog) and [projects](/projects) pages is really jarring. i'm going to have to fix that. i'm going to have to make the scrolling pages non-scrolling with some shadcn/ui magic. oh, this will be fun (alastor reference).

something else thats fun is that ive recently been seriously desperately needing to obtain the domain martindev.com. ive been checking the whois almost every day to see if it has expired yet. i'm going to buy it the second it expires. i'm going to have to be quick because i know someone else is going to try and buy it. i'm not going to let that happen otherwise i will cry forever.

i think that's all for now. i'm going to have some breakfast and then drive a train (on train sim world 2 because i'm not a train driver also i paused xbox game pass so i can't play 3 or 4). i hope you all have a great day too.
