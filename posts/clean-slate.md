# from the top!

i am BACK!! ive been focusing so much on studies and private projects that i forgot about the blog on my website. my bad gng!! so what better way to embrace the future than to *delete everything*?

kidding lmao its not deleted theyre just tucked away in a renamed folder. anyways life update:
- i am over halfway through my first year of sixth form oooo scarryy
- i am doing a levels in computer science (i know right, shocker), maths and physics
- i am also doing an EPQ (google it) on the topic of the renationalisation of the railways in the UK because i am a nerd :p
- i got banned from the SCR discord! i was so outspoken against their power-hungry moderation team and money hungry directors but apparently the tipping point was be verbally abusing someone who *raided another server*. with hardenclad evidence i might add! dumbasses
- i made another discord bot made specifically for a server i am in but its a pretty insane server and certain people who i know browse this blog would probably disapprove of it, so i shan't share it. each to their own i guess
- 10 hours of driving lessons, im pretty much qualified to drive now. hahahahaaaa!
- oybievnfiwodeueibvoebverucfijeorhviuevyrhbngsfdpmewiruihdwdomrnutdnem2spmervinuedmois2eirniejdmwkojrihed
- i got a new phone! i am now the proud owner of an iphone 16. its a pretty good jump from my 11! i no longer have to worry about the battery dying the moment i disconnect it from the charger at 100%!
- i am now a proud owner of a printer! finally! anyways...
- i am OUT of my hazbin hotel phase. not my proudest few months...
- trump is president again! i am so happy! we can finally crash the WOKE stock market, end WOKE immigration, deport INNOCENT people, stop the SPREAD of WOKE autism, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! i am so happy that the WOKE left is finally getting what they deserve. trump is the best president ever and i am so glad he is back in office!! (because some of you are tone-deaf let it be known that this is a joke and i hate trump and everything he stands for)

so there's a little update on my life. maybe i'll actually remember about this place next time round.
